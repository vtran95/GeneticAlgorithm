# Genetic Algorithm

A genetic algorithm is an algorithm that draws inspiration from theories of natural selection. We
start with a ‘population’ of sample candidates, evaluate their fitness, perform some sort of cross-over and
mutation, and continue until we have a solution that most closely meets our needs or meets our termination criteria.

Referencing the "Travelling Salesman" problem, this algorithm will determine the shortest possible route starting
at one city, visiting each city, and then returning to the original city.

Each city coordinate is in an [x,y] range from [0,1000].
